## Sidefolio - Portfolio website template

# Welcome!
Kia ora, I'm Mandy, Welcome to my portfolio! It's currently a WIP. *//TODO update to LIVE :D* 
I am building my portfolio using `React` with the `Next.JS` framework and using the Sidefolio - Portfolio website template for my foundation from [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/templtes/sidefolio). I wanted to use some nice transitions and interactions, and convey some parts of my personality as a obsessive note-taker, writer, and fan of clean, simplicity and user friendliness.  I am using `Tailwind` and `TypeScript` because I love them both. Tailwind because life is just easier and Typescript because I find it so helpful for knowing what I'm working with, debugging and just the certainty it gives me!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
