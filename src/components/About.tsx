          Hi there, I&apos;m Mandy - a web developer on a mission to build
          technology and solutions that have a{' '}
          <span className="text-sea-green-700">positive impact</span> on people
          and communities.

        <Paragraph>
          As a full-stack developer with a background in marketing and
          communications, I bring a unique blend of human and technical skills
          to every project, giving me an excellent ability to create
          user-centered solutions. Based in ÅŒtautahi (Christchurch), Aotearoa
          (New Zealand) and with extensive experience as a remote worker,
          I&apos;m able to effectively collaborate across cross-functional teams
          in hybrid and fully remote environments.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          My approach is built on three core values: challenge, collaboration
          and communication. I thrive on challenge; complex problems are
          opportunities for growth and new approaches. I believe good teamwork
          is key for innovation, so collaboration and supporting colleagues to
          achieve shared goals is important to me. I prioritise clear
          communication to support alignment between goals, expectations and
          outcomes through active listening, documentation, and establishing
          feedback loops with clients and stakeholders.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          When I&apos;m not at my computer, you&apos;ll find me embracing the
          outdoors as a water woman, mountain biker, and trail runner. I&apos;m
          also a yoga teacher and actively contribute to my community as a
          member of Climate Action Tech, Women in Tech Christchurch, and as a
          volunteer Surf Life Guard at Taylors Mistake Surf Life Saving Club.
